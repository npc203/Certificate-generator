# Certificate-generator
 Totally unsecure and fake certificate generator
 
 Just another excuse to learn flask better
## TODOs
- Issue of having non-ascii letters messing up with file names (fix: use hashmaps OwO)
- Totally didn't do any handling of errors.
- Some sort of progress bar during list zipping.
- Some sort of security feature (to prevent fakery OwO) ?
- Better UI LoL
- Should I remove the tmp files after making them?

## Usage
- Clone it, run it
- For the list upload, Simply have a text file with all the names, separated line by line
